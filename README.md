A Java based Appointment book with a GWT interface.

@author Mohammed Mchichou.
In this Project, you can create an appointment and add it to an appointment Book.
Each appointment has the owner name, a description and begin and end date and time.
The begin and end time format must be as following: MM/DD/YYYY hours:minutes am/pm.
The time must be in H:MM AM/PM format
Display will list all appointments of a specific owner.
Search will display appointments of an owner between a specific begin and end time

You can build your project with mvn package and can launch GWTâ€™s development mode with mvn
gwt:run
Then you will be able to access the Web UI here :
